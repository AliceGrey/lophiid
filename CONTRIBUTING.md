# Contributing to Our Project

We welcome and appreciate contributions! Here's how you can contribute:

## Contribution Guidelines:

* For larger changes: ensure GitHub issue exists in which you propose your change and the approach for implementing it. We can discuss the approach in the bug to ensure the implementation will be compatible with the overall design and other ongoing changes.
* Always add or update tests
* Keep the style of your code consistent with the rest of the project
* Allow for some delay in reviewing your PR (day or two max)
