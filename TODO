Show vulnerable landing pages, random server headers.

Rename contentlocation.location to path
x Add Server header to content database and response.

Allow multiple content to match a single content rule. Pick a random one OR
sequantial (make it optional).

Maybe even CVEs.

Create a page with links to all content rules. Only indexable by Google ;P

Allow bruteforcing of login pages.

If multiple content rules match, instead of returning a random one, track per IP
which one was already returned and return another.

Check regex for contentrule when creating or updating the entry

Proper slog implementation - add LogValue to fields

Allow multiple servers to be specified per content.

reWrite more tests for API server.

Finish the requests UI interface

Add "application" and link content and rules to the application. Also display
